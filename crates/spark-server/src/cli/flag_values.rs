//! The closed value sets of the enumerated `spark serve` string flags.
//!
//! Two consumers read these: `validate::check_enum`, which REFUSES a value
//! outside the set, and the dashboard's option picker, which OFFERS the set.
//! They used to be able to disagree — the validator's lists lived inline in
//! `validate.rs` and anything else wanting them had to copy them, and a copy
//! drifts into the worst failure mode a picker has: offering a value the
//! server refuses, or hiding one it accepts. One module, one list per flag.
//!
//! `--kv-cache-dtype` is deliberately NOT a const here: its authority is
//! `spark_runtime::kv_cache::KvCacheDtype`, whose `catalog` module derives
//! the list from the enum under a wildcard-free match — adding a variant
//! fails the build there rather than silently missing from this picker.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT wired into clap as `PossibleValuesParser`s. That would
//! move the typo diagnosis from `validate_serve_args` — which reports every
//! problem at once, with what/why/fix — into clap, which exits on the first.
//! It would also be a second enforcement point over the same data, and two
//! enforcement points is how the two disagree. clap stays the authority on
//! the flag SURFACE (names, help, defaults, arity); this module is the
//! authority on the enumerated VALUES; `validate.rs` is the one place they
//! are enforced.
