//! Whole-prompt drafter context: the capture write and its EAGER consume.
//!
//! # The defect this file closes (measured recon, 2026-07-28)
//!
//! `mtp_prefill_hidden` is ONE shared slot stamped with a generation
//! (`mtp_prefill_capture_gen`). The consume used to live at the first
//! `propose` of a sequence (`ensure_drafter_context`), which is one or more
//! scheduler ticks after that sequence's prefill. At C >= 2 the sequences
//! prefill back-to-back, so by the time sequence `k` proposes, sequence
//! `k+1`'s prefill has already restarted the capture — the ownership stamp
//! then correctly refuses to build drafter KV from another sequence's
//! hiddens ("blind beats poisoned"), and every sequence but the LAST-prefilled
//! one runs a drafter that never saw its prompt.
//!
//! Worse, since `e793d1c5` ("fix the can_mix spec gate") a `--speculative`
//! serve takes the MIXED path for requests 3..n
//! (`run_standard.rs`: `spec_step_this_tick = active.len() == 1`), and
//! `mixed_forward_dispatch` never captured at all. At C=8 that is ~6 of 8
//! sequences drafting blind.
//!
//! # The fix
//!
//! Two halves, both behind `ATLAS_NO_MTP_EAGER_DRAFTER` (PRESENCE):
//!
//! 1. `try_mtp_prefill_capture_from` — the capture body, parameterised by the
//!    SOURCE pointer, so the mixed path can hand it the prefill rows (which
//!    live at `hidden + padded_n * h`, NOT at the head of the buffer: copying
//!    from the head there would capture the DECODE rows, i.e. poison rather
//!    than blindness).
//! 2. `try_eager_drafter_prefill` — consume the capture at the END of the
//!    sequence's own prefill, while it provably still owns the generation
//!    stamp. Called from the `Model` trait wrappers in `mod.rs` (the single
//!    funnel all four prefill entry points pass through) AFTER the dispatch
//!    returns, so `seq.tokens` / `seq.prompt_len` are already updated.
//!
//! Nothing about the guard set changes: `ensure_drafter_context` still
//! enforces `captured >= prompt_len`, the ownership stamp, and first-propose.
//! Moving it earlier only means the guards can now PASS for more than one
//! sequence per serve. The propose-site call stays (it is the WARM-turn carry
//! entry point and a no-op once the drafter owns rows).
//!
//! Cost: `prefill_drafter` is ~0.095 ms/row and now runs inside TTFT instead
//! of inside the first decode step. It fires only when the capture covers the
//! whole prompt — i.e. exactly the COLD-turn case that already paid it one
//! tick later. A warm turn (prefix reuse / Marconi restore) leaves the capture
//! short, so this adds nothing to the ~1136 ms warm rebuild trap documented in
//! `mtp_carry`.
